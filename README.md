# NLP Lab 2: Regex and Word Embedding

**Instructor**: Pr. Lotfi Elaachak  
**Course**: Master AISD, Département Génie Informatique  
**University**: Université Abdelmalek Essaadi, Faculté des Sciences et Techniques de Tanger  
**Student**: NOUIH Omar

## Objective

The primary goal of this lab is to introduce students to Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, focusing on Rule-based NLP, Regex, and Word Embedding.

## Part 1: Rule-Based NLP and Regex

### Task Description

Implement Python code using Regex to generate a bill from the provided text. The code should be able to extract product names, quantities, and prices to calculate total costs.

### Example

**Input**: "I bought three Samsung smartphones at $150 each, four kilos of fresh bananas for $1.2 a kilogram, and one Hamburger for $4.5."  
**Expected Output**: A table displaying the product, quantity, unit price, and total price.

### Implementation

The implementation involves using Regex to extract relevant information from the text and calculating the total bill based on the extracted data.

## Part 2: Word Embedding Techniques

### Techniques Covered

1. One Hot Encoding
2. Bag of Words
3. TF-IDF
4. Word2Vec Approaches (Skip Gram, CBOW)
5. GloVe and FastText

### Visualization and Evaluation

Apply the t-SNE algorithm to visualize the word embeddings generated by each technique and evaluate their effectiveness in capturing semantic information.
